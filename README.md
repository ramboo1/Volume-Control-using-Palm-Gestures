# Volume-Control-using-Palm-Gestures
Thsi project mainly uses OpenCV and pycaw modules to let the user change the volume of his/her computer using palm gestures.

The module works by recognising the landmarks of the index finger and the thumb and simultaneously calculating the between these points. More the distance, more will be the volume.
